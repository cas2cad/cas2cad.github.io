# CasCAD Introduction


Under the guide of parallel intelligenceï¼ŒcasCAD aims to validate and enhance governance mechanisms through the usage of simulation and cognitive analog, where it takes the subjected mechanism design as an input to artificial model the corresponding virtual environment along with various behaviors entities so-called "Agents". These agents with the virtual environment complete the continuous simulation cycle through the variety of experiments and behaviors, and that is to provide the sufficient historical patterns required for the validation and the adjustment of the projected mechanism. 


# Motivation of casCAD

DAO is not a simple system in nature, but a complex system composed of a large number of adaptable and interacting individuals, affected by economic incentives. It involves unexpected psychological behaviors, diversified mechanics strategies, competition, cooperation and games. 
The traditional system mechanism analysis model has the following charac-teristics:

    1.Most of them are based on the description of the macro-physical structure of the system and the optimization of macro-physical quantities. The emphasis is on the study of the macroscopic laws of the system, and the qualitative description of the macroscopic characteristics is biased.
    2.Quantitative research mostly uses macro-statistical methods.
    3.The traditional economic model oversimplifies the system structure relationship.


The above analysis model has inherent deficiencies in understanding the complexity of the system mechanism:
    1.Ignore the behavioral differences and initiative of micro-subjects participating in financial product transactions in the system.
    2.It is difficult to explain the changes caused by the interaction between the external factors of the system and the internal participants.
    3.It is difficult to quantify the differences, limited rational participation and active learning of the micro-subjects participating in the composition of the system.


The problems faced by the actual system due to the lack of effective experiments and evaluation methods can be solved by constructing corresponding experimental acenarios in the virtual system. Simulating and observing the various states and development characteristics of the virtual system in the experiment can assist in reasoning and forecasting the evolutionary law of the actual system, and analyze the effectiveness of its mechanism logic. In the virtual scene, a bottom-up modeling method is adopted to establish one or more virtual systems "accompanied" with the real system.


The core feature of this model can simulate the real behavior of the subject, analyze the characteristics of real economic behaviors in a more comprehensive and in-depth manner. At the same time, it can also study the micro-causes and structural effects of many phenomena and events, and then through the "macro emergence" of micro-events, further study, analyze and explain the turning, sudden changes, jumps and turbulence of macroscopic phenomena.


Therefore, we create casCAD, a parallel governance tool to address problems faced by DAOs. Specially, we try to answer the following question of DAO:

    1. What if I change the system parameters?
    2. What if the user's behavior changed?
    3. What if I am not sure whether the mechanism is effective?
